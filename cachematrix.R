## The following functions are used to create a special object that stores 
## a matrix and caches its inverse.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix, creates a special "matrix", which is 
## really a list containing a function to:
##
##    1. set the value of the matrix
##    2. get the value of the matrix
##    3. set the value of the inverse
##    4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
      i <- NULL
      set <- function(y){
            x <<- y
            i <<- NULL
      }
      get <- function() x
      setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
      getinverse <- function() i
      list(set = set,
      get = get,
      setinverse = setinverse,
      getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The second function, cacheSolve, computes the inverse of the special 
## "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been
## calculated (and the matrix has not changed) then cacheSolve should
## retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
     i <- x$getinverse()
     if (!is.null(i)) {
           message("getting cached data")
           return(i)
     }
data <- x$get()
i <- solve(data, ...)
x$setinverse(i)
i
}
